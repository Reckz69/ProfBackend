//cookies: small files stored on client side (browser) to store user session data and preferences
//In express, we use cookie-parser middleware to parse cookies from incoming requests and set cookies in responses.
//It provides easy access to cookies via req.cookies and res.cookie() methods.
//CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a security feature implemented by browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
//In express, we use the cors middleware to configure CORS settings, allowing or restricting cross-origin requests based on specified rules.
//This is important for enabling secure interactions between frontend and backend hosted on different domains.

//dotenv: dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env in Node.js applications.
//This allows developers to manage configuration settings (like API keys, database URIs, etc.) separately from the codebase, enhancing security and flexibility across different environments (development, testing, production).

//mongoose async/await: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.
//Using async/await with Mongoose allows developers to write asynchronous database operations in a more synchronous and readable manner.
//This helps in handling operations like connecting to the database, querying, and updating documents without blocking the event loop, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
